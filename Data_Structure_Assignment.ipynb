        "This efficiency is due to the underlying implementation of dictionaries as hash tables. When a key-value pair is stored, the key is passed through a hash function, which generates a hash value. This hash value is then used to determine a specific memory location (or \"bucket\") where the value is stored. When retrieving a value, the same hash function is applied to the key, leading directly to the location of the stored value.\n",
        "However, in the worst-case scenario, the time complexity can degrade to O(n), where 'n' is the number of elements in the dictionary. This worst case occurs when there are a large number of hash collisions, meaning multiple keys generate the same hash value. If collisions are frequent, the dictionary might have to resort to a linear search within a bucket or a more complex collision resolution strategy, leading to a performance closer to searching through a list. Modern hash table implementations, including Python's, are designed to minimize the occurrence of such worst-case scenarios through sophisticated hash functions and collision resolution techniques, making O(1) the expected and common performance.\n"
